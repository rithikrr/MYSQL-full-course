# MYSQL-full-course
This repository contains my MYSQL learning from udemy certification called "Business Intelligence Analyst course 2025". I have learnt and practiced the queries for various topics like basic DDL, DML commands, manipulating tables values using aggregate functions, joins (left,right,outer,cross), nested queries, storage routines, window functions, common table expressions, temporary table. The follwing learning was done in MYSQL workbench 8.0 platform. I have renamed the "employees" database from the practice file as "workers" in the file for my reference.
